# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

Epoch Buddy respects your privacy.

## Data Collection
Epoch Buddy does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The app does not require user accounts and does not track users.

## Data Usage
All information displayed in the app (such as Solana epoch timing and slot progress) is fetched from public blockchain or public network sources and is used solely to display information to the user.

## Notifications
If enabled, notifications are generated locally on your device. No notification data is sent to or stored on external servers.

## Third-Party Services
Epoch Buddy does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Security
Because no personal data is collected or stored, there is no personal data at risk of exposure.

## Changes to This Policy
If the app’s behavior changes in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
